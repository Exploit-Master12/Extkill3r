Extkill3r is an exploit made by <a href="https://github.com/Exploit-Master12">Exploit-Master12</a> that can kill extensions for a long time.
It works by loading many iframes into a small space in tiny windows rapidly that lags the extension. :)
The name was inspired by <a href="https://github.com/Blobby-Boi/">Blobby Boi</a> 

If you do not use it correctly,it will kill your computer instead of extension!!!!! ⚠️⚠️⚠️  (More coming soon)

So,here it is:
